<p>To manage your own notification preferences, click on the
“Notification settings” tab on your “My account” page.</p>

<p>The “Master switch” overrides all other settings for Notify. You
can use it to suspend notifications without having to disturb any of
your settings under “Detailed settings” and “Subscriptions”.</p>

<p>The “Detailed settings” determine what is included in each
notification.  You can turn on or off notification of new content and
new comments, and specify how much of the original content to include
in the notification email.</p>

<p>The “Subscriptions” panel allow each user to manage individual
notifications by content type.</p>

<p>Note that for users with the permission “administer notify queue”,
it is possible to subscribe to content types that are not generally
available for subscription.  This allows administrators to
monitor <em>all</em> new content on the site, without making it
subscribable for non-administrators.</p>
